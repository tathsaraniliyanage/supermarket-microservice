The project is composed of the following services:

1. **Eureka Server (Spring Boot, Maven)**
   - Service discovery server that allows other microservices to register themselves and discover other services.

2. **API Gateway (Spring Boot, Maven)**

3. **Customer Service (Python)**
   - Manages customer-related operations such as customer registration, profile management, etc.

4. **Inventory Service (Spring Boot, Maven, Gradle)**
   - Handles inventory management, including product stock levels, updates, and queries.

5. **Order Service (Spring Boot, Maven, Gradle)**
   - Manages order processing, including order creation, status updates, and order history.

6. **Product Service (Spring Boot, Maven)**
